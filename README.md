# JS Local Storage and Event Delegation

## Description

This exercise consists on a TODO list that the user can modify by:

* Adding new tasks with the submit button
* Checking or unchecking them depending on their status with a customized checkbox
* Deleting them if needed by clicking in the minus icon

All information and task status is saved in the user's local storage, so that it will be available when refreshing the page.
